# night-train-apis
A collection of APIs of different night train providers.

An interactive SwaggerUI with API definitions can be found on [GitHub Pages](https://martinlangbecker.github.io/night-train-apis/).

If you're using Google Chrome, it will block all requests from SwaggerUI by default. To circumvent this, you can create a new shortcut to Google Chrome and append the following parameters: `--disable-web-security -user-data-dir=~` (note: single dash in front of `user-data-dir`). The directory for `user-data-dir` is not important, but it needs to exist on the local file system.
